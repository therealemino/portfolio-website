            My World Outside of Software Development
          </h5>
          <p>
            While I'm deeply passionate about crafting innovative software
            solutions, my world extends far beyond the digital realm. Here are a
            few of my interests that fuel my creativity and keep me grounded:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-4">
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong className="font-medium">Art:</strong> I have a deep
              appreciation for art in all its forms. From paintings and
              sculptures to photography and even fashion. Art has the power to
              evoke emotions and enrich our lives.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong className="font-medium">Music:</strong> To put it simply,
              I love music. I live for it. Just like any other art form, good
              music evokes emotions and emotions make the life experience more
              beautiful. Check out some of my favourite curated Spotify {" "}

              .
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong className="font-medium">Sports:</strong> Football in
              particular. I was born a Liverpool fan and I intend to die that
              way. I also love tennis, badmington. I wouldn't say I love
              basketball, I just love watching Steph play.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong className="font-medium">Anime:</strong> I'm a fan of the
              new generation of anime. JJK, AOT, Demon Slayer, Vinland Saga,
              etc. Expect to hear more about anime from me in the near future...

            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong className="font-medium">Gaming:</strong> Gaming serves as
              a great way for me to relax and unwind. While I'm not a hardcore
              competitive gamer, I enjoy the immersive experiences it offers.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong className="font-medium">Adventures:</strong> So typically,
              I love staying indoors, but nature has a calming effect on me. I
              love hiking, camping, exploring new destinations and taking late night
              walks/drive.
